# NewYearKata2022
New Years Kata for 2022

Every year I dedicate part of my holidays around new year to learn new things and skills 
for myself. I have done this personal New Years Kata since 2015 - when I realized that
Machine Learning and AI reached a major step. What particularly struck me, was the paper
of A. Karpathy combining a CNN and an LSTM network to describe the content of an image.

This is when I realized that something escaped my attention for some years, and I have to
reassess my skills every year. Therefore this New Year Kata became my way to assess and
reshape my skills, such that I can start the next year with a new trick.

Former Katas were about AI-supported Software Development and contained challenges to
generate code. That project then got then steamrolled 18 Month later, when tab-nine
presented such an assistant. But all these AI-Code-Assistants are trying to optimize
the wrong part of sofwtare development.

So what is this years Kata about?

Some options are:
* Machine Learning (J Howard - Stable diffusion implemntation / tutorial)
* A Dataset-Labelling Tool (actually there are many of them now, so why this one?)
* Continue on the FEC-Archiver-Project and regain knowledge on
  * channel coding, 
  * GF(256)-Math,
  * RS-Codes as well as the classic
  * Decoder algorithms

Usually I will focus on one single topic - So let's see which will emerge as the most 
interesting one.

Happy new Year!
